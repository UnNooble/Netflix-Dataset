We observe that certain countries not only have a higher number of subscribers but also contribute significantly to the platform's revenue. This indicates potential markets for targeted advertising or exclusive content launches. The data also reveals a varied device usage pattern among subscribers, emphasizing the importance of ensuring optimal streaming quality across all platforms. Interestingly, the more expensive subscriptions do not always lead to more profit. Understanding these nuances, even from a hypothetical dataset, is instrumental for strategic planning in areas like content creation and marketing campaigns.")
